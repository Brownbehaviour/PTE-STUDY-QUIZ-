            // Handout 1: GMP (85 Questions)
            { id: 1, category: "GMP", question: "During a routine internal audit of a tablet packaging line, an operator is observed using a personal, non-company-issued pen to sign off on a line clearance checklist. Which GMP violation is most critical?", options: { A: "The use of a non-standardized pen for documentation.", B: "The potential for ink to be non-archival and fade over time.", C: "The introduction of an uncontrolled item into the production area, posing a contamination risk.", D: "The failure to have a supervisor co-sign the checklist immediately." }, correct: "C", explanation: "The most critical violation is introducing an uncontrolled personal item into the production environment, which poses a direct contamination risk. This is a more severe GMP breach than documentation or procedural issues." },
            { id: 2, category: "GMP", question: "A batch record for a sterile injectable shows the final sterilization step was completed 2 hours later than the SOP time, with no deviation report. A regulatory inspector would be most concerned because:", options: { A: "It suggests a lack of operator discipline.", B: "It creates a minor inconsistency in the timeline.", C: "It indicates a potential failure to maintain the validated state of the process, which could compromise product sterility.", D: "It shows QA is not reviewing records in real-time." }, correct: "C", explanation: "A delay in a critical step like sterilization falls outside validated parameters and could compromise the sterility assurance level, a significant failure of the quality system impacting patient safety." },
            { id: 3, category: "GMP", question: "An investigation into a product complaint for discoloration of an oral liquid reveals the manufacturing tank, made of 304 stainless steel, was used to hold a highly acidic intermediate. The primary reason this is a critical GMP failure is:", options: { A: "304 stainless steel is never appropriate for pharma use.", B: "The extended hold time was not documented.", C: "The acidic intermediate likely caused leaching of metallic ions from the tank, leading to product contamination.", D: "The equipment breakdown was not reported promptly." }, correct: "C", explanation: "The core issue is product contamination. The interaction between the acidic product and the tank material likely caused metal ions to leach into the product, directly causing the quality defect and posing a safety risk." },
            { id: 4, category: "GMP", question: "A company qualifies its water for injection (WFI) system. To ensure ongoing compliance, the most critical control is:", options: { A: "Annual re-validation of the entire system.", B: "Daily visual inspection of the holding tank.", C: "A routine monitoring program including regular sampling for microbial counts, endotoxins, and conductivity.", D: "Checking the maintenance logs of the distribution pumps every month." }, correct: "C", explanation: "While re-validation is important, a continuous, routine monitoring program provides real-time assurance that the system remains in a state of control between validation activities, which is essential for product safety." },
            { id: 5, category: "GMP", question: "A new operator is trained on a tablet compression machine. Which record is most essential for a GMP auditor to verify their competence?", options: { A: "A certificate of attendance from a generic machine operation course.", B: "The operator's signature on the SOP read-and-understood log.", C: "A completed training record that includes documented evidence of successful, supervised qualification runs.", D: "A verbal confirmation from the shift supervisor." }, correct: "C", explanation: "GMP requires proof of effective training. A documented record showing the operator was not just trained but also assessed and proven competent to perform the task independently is the strongest evidence of qualification." },
            { id: 6, category: "GMP", question: "What is the primary purpose of line clearance before starting a packaging operation?", options: { A: "To ensure the operators are ready for the new batch.", B: "To prevent mix-ups and cross-contamination from previous batches.", C: "To allow time for the equipment to warm up.", D: "To complete the required paperwork for the new batch." }, correct: "B", explanation: "Line clearance is a critical GMP step to ensure that all materials, labels, and products from the previous run have been removed, thereby preventing the accidental mix-up or contamination of the new batch." },
            { id: 7, category: "GMP", question: "If a batch of tablets fails the dissolution test at the finished product stage, what is the most appropriate initial action?", options: { A: "Immediately discard the entire batch.", B: "Rework the tablets by applying an additional coating.", C: "Initiate a laboratory investigation to confirm the out-of-specification (OOS) result.", D: "Release the batch with a note about the dissolution failure." }, correct: "C", explanation: "An OOS result must first be investigated to rule out laboratory error. Only after the OOS is confirmed can a decision be made about the batch's disposition, based on a full manufacturing investigation." },
            { id: 8, category: "GMP", question: "During a self-inspection, 'rejected' materials are stored next to 'quarantined' materials, separated only by a yellow line on the floor. Why would a regulator find this critical?", options: { A: "The yellow line may fade over time.", B: "It increases the risk of accidental use of rejected materials in production.", C: "The storage area for rejected materials is not large enough.", D: "The warehouse operators have not been trained on the color-coding system." }, correct: "B", explanation: "Rejected materials must be securely and physically segregated from all other materials to prevent any possibility of them being mistakenly used in manufacturing. A line on the floor is not considered adequate segregation." },
            { id: 9, category: "GMP", question: "Which of these is a fundamental requirement for personnel working in a pharmaceutical production area?", options: { A: "Having a university degree in pharmacy.", B: "Observing a high level of personal hygiene and wearing appropriate protective clothing.", C: "Being able to operate all equipment in the facility.", D: "Working at the company for at least one year." }, correct: "B", explanation: "Personal hygiene and proper gowning are fundamental GMP requirements for all personnel to prevent contamination of the product." },
            { id: 10, category: "GMP", question: "A manufacturer of a penicillin-based product wants to produce a cephalosporin antibiotic in the same facility. Why is this generally prohibited under GMP?", options: { A: "The two drug classes have different manufacturing processes.", B: "It would require too much investment in new equipment.", C: "There is a high risk of cross-contamination, which can cause severe allergic reactions in sensitized patients.", D: "The market for cephalosporins is not as profitable." }, correct: "C", explanation: "Beta-lactam products like penicillins are highly sensitizing. GMP requires dedicated, separate facilities for their production to prevent cross-contamination that could lead to life-threatening anaphylactic shock in patients." },
            { id: 11, category: "GMP", question: "The primary goal of a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) system is to:", options: { A: "Assign blame for deviations.", B: "Address and eliminate the root causes of existing and potential non-conformities.", C: "Create more paperwork for the Quality department.", D: "Fulfill a checklist item for an audit." }, correct: "B", explanation: "CAPA is a systematic approach to investigate, address, and prevent the recurrence of issues by identifying and eliminating their root causes, forming a cornerstone of a robust quality management system." },
            { id: 12, category: "GMP", question: "In a pharmaceutical warehouse, the principle of FIFO is often used. What does it stand for?", options: { A: "First-In, First-Out", B: "Fast-In, Fast-Out", C: "Final-In, First-Out", D: "First-In, Final-Out" }, correct: "A", explanation: "First-In, First-Out (FIFO) is a stock rotation principle ensuring that the oldest stock is used first, which is critical for managing materials with expiry dates." },
            { id: 13, category: "GMP", question: "What is the primary risk of inadequate cleaning validation for manufacturing equipment?", options: { A: "Increased cleaning time for operators.", B: "Higher consumption of cleaning agents.", C: "Cross-contamination of the subsequent product with residues from the previous product.", D: "Faster wear and tear on the equipment." }, correct: "C", explanation: "Cleaning validation provides documented evidence that a cleaning procedure consistently removes residues to predetermined levels. Failure to do so creates a significant risk of cross-contaminating the next batch, affecting its purity and safety." },
            { id: 14, category: "GMP", question: "During IQ/OQ/PQ of a new tablet press, the 'PQ' (Performance Qualification) phase primarily demonstrates that:", options: { A: "The equipment has been installed correctly and all parts are present.", B: "The equipment's operational controls work as intended within specified limits.", C: "The equipment, as part of the specific manufacturing process, consistently produces a product meeting all quality attributes.", D: "The user manuals and SOPs for the equipment are well-written." }, correct: "C", explanation: "PQ is the final stage of qualification, where the equipment is tested with the actual product formula under normal manufacturing conditions to prove it can consistently produce a quality product over time." },
            { id: 15, category: "GMP", question: "A stability study is conducted on a new drug product. The primary purpose of this study is to:", options: { A: "Determine the product's selling price.", B: "Establish the shelf-life and recommended storage conditions.", C: "Test the effectiveness of the marketing campaign.", D: "Decide on the color of the packaging." }, correct: "B", explanation: "Stability studies are essential for determining how the quality of a drug product varies with time under the influence of environmental factors, which is used to establish its expiration date and storage instructions." },
            { id: 16, category: "GMP", question: "An operator notices a critical sensor on a fluid bed dryer is displaying an error message. The correct immediate action is to:", options: { A: "Try to fix the sensor themselves.", B: "Ignore the message and continue the process.", C: "Stop the process, quarantine the batch, and report the issue to a supervisor and Quality Assurance.", D: "Make a note in their personal diary to report it later." }, correct: "C", explanation: "Operating equipment with a malfunctioning critical sensor violates GMP as the process is no longer in a state of control. The process must be stopped immediately to prevent producing a non-compliant batch, and the issue must be formally reported." },
            { id: 17, category: "GMP", question: "Which of the following is NOT a core principle of Good Manufacturing Practice?", options: { A: "Preventing contamination and mix-ups.", B: "Ensuring job competence through training.", C: "Maximizing production output at all costs.", D: "Making clear and accurate records." }, correct: "C", explanation: "While efficiency is important, GMP prioritizes product quality and patient safety over production speed. Cutting corners to maximize output is a direct violation of GMP principles." },

The ongoing program confirms that commercial production batches are also stable, providing continued assurance of the product's quality over its lifetime." },
            { id: 234, category: "Documentation", question: "A 'quarantine' label on a container indicates that the material:", options: { A: "Is ready to be used.", B: "Is awaiting testing and a release decision from the Quality Unit.", C: "Has been rejected.", D: "Is a cleaning agent." }, correct: "B", explanation: "The quarantine status is a holding state. It clearly communicates that the material must not be used until it has been formally approved by QC, preventing the premature use of un-tested materials." },
            { id: 235, category: "Documentation", question: "The use of color-coded labels for status (e.g., green for released, red for rejected) is a good practice because:", options: { A: "It makes the warehouse look festive.", B: "It provides a clear, immediate visual indication of a material's status, reducing the risk of mix-ups.", C: "It is required by the fire department.", D: "It helps people who cannot read." }, correct: "B", explanation: "While the text on the label is the official status, color-coding provides a quick, at-a-glance confirmation that reinforces the status and helps prevent an operator from accidentally picking up the wrong material." },
            { id: 236, category: "Documentation", question: "The label on a finished medicine must include the batch number and expiry date in an uncoded form to:", options: { A: "Make the label look more crowded.", B: "Provide clear, unambiguous information for the patient, pharmacist, and for traceability purposes.", C: "Test the patient's eyesight.", D: "Hide the information from competitors." }, correct: "B", explanation: "This information is critical for the end-user and for the supply chain. It must be easy to read and understand to ensure the product is used safely and can be traced if necessary." },
            { id: 237, category: "Documentation", question: "A 'pharmacopoeia' is a reference book that contains:", options: { A: "A list of all pharmacies in the country.", B: "Official standards and specifications for pharmaceutical substances and products.", C: "A history of the pharmaceutical industry.", D: "A dictionary of medical terms." }, correct: "B", explanation: "Pharmacopoeias (like the USP, BP, EP) provide official monographs that define the quality standards for many common drugs and excipients. They are a key reference for setting specifications." },

A defined procedure is necessary to ensure the sample accurately reflects the quality of the entire batch from which it was taken." },
            { id: 239, category: "Documentation", question: "A 'change control' record should document:", options: { A: "Only the date of the change.", B: "The details of the proposed change, the justification for it, an evaluation of its potential impact, and the approval signatures.", C: "Who to blame if the change goes wrong.", D: "A rumor about a potential change." }, correct: "B", explanation: "A change control record is a comprehensive document that provides a complete history of a change, ensuring it was properly planned, assessed for risk, and formally approved before being implemented." },
            { id: 240, category: "Documentation", question: "The 'validation protocol' is a document that:", options: { A: "Summarizes the results of a validation study after it is complete.", B: "Describes in advance how a validation study will be conducted, including the acceptance criteria.", C: "Is a logbook of all validation activities.", D: "Is a purchase order for validation services." }, correct: "B", explanation: "The protocol is the plan. It is written and approved before the validation work begins and it defines the objectives, procedures, and pre-determined acceptance criteria against which the results will be judged." },
            { id: 241, category: "Documentation", question: "The 'validation report' is a document that:", options: { A: "Is written before the validation study is performed.", B: "Presents the results and data from the validation study and provides a conclusion on whether the acceptance criteria were met.", C: "Is a general discussion about validation.", D: "Is a certificate for the operator." }, correct: "B", explanation: "The report is the final summary of the validation exercise. It documents the results, analyzes the data, and formally declares whether the system or process has met the pre-defined requirements in the protocol and is therefore considered validated." },
            { id: 242, category: "Documentation", question: "Why must training records be maintained for all GMP personnel?", options: { A: "To prove that employees have been adequately trained and are qualified to perform their assigned tasks.", B: "To keep the HR department busy.", C: "To see who has the best attendance.", D: "It is not a requirement." }, correct: "A", explanation: "Training records are the documented evidence of competence. During an audit, they are used to verify that every person performing a GMP task has been properly trained and assessed for that task." },

Bound, numbered pages and permanent ink are standard requirements." },
            { id: 244, category: "Documentation", question: "If a 'deviation' occurs during manufacturing, it must be:", options: { A: "Ignored.", B: "Documented, investigated, and its potential impact on the batch assessed by the Quality Unit.", C: "Corrected without telling anyone.", D: "Reported only if it seems serious." }, correct: "B", explanation: "All departures from procedure, no matter how small they may seem, must be documented. This is a fundamental principle of maintaining process control and ensuring that any potential impact on product quality is properly evaluated." },
            { id: 245, category: "Documentation", question: "The primary risk of poor documentation practices is that:", options: { A: "The company might run out of paper.", B: "It can lead to process errors, product defects, and a failure to demonstrate compliance to regulatory authorities.", C: "It makes the factory look untidy.", D: "It is a minor issue." }, correct: "B", explanation: "Good documentation is the bedrock of GMP. Without it, there is no consistency, no traceability, and no proof of quality. Poor documentation is one of the most common sources of regulatory citations." },
            { id: 246, category: "Documentation", question: "The 'approval' of a document like an SOP signifies that:", options: { A: "The document has been read by someone.", B: "An authorized and qualified person has reviewed the document and agrees that it is correct and fit for purpose.", C: "The document is a draft.", D: "The document is ready to be thrown away." }, correct: "B", explanation: "The approval signature is the formal authorization that gives the document its official status. It confirms that the procedure has been vetted and is now the required way of performing the task." },
